// What are Modules ?

// Modules allow you to split your code into multiple files and import/export them as needed.


// Why ?

// Organize code into small, manageable chunks
// Reuse functions, classes or variables across files.
// Avoids name collisions (due to scoped exports).
// Improves maintainability and testing.


// Export will be done in two ways
    // default
    // named export
